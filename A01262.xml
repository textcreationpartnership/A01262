            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:27222:5"/> and not conteining al neceſſary truth, but that there are many articles of neceſsitye to be beleeued which are not conteined in the ſcriptures.

As though thoſe things remained more ſure which be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to the fraile memory of feble men in this ſinful world: then thoſe things that by the ſpirit of god are put in writing. This is the cauſe why they blaſphemouſly cal the ſacred written word of God,<note place="margin">The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy.</note> a dead writing, a dumbe Maiſter, doubtfull and vncertaine, A black goſpell, dead inke, inkie diuinitye, A noſe of waxe, a leaden rule, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This is the cauſe why they ſay that the ſcriptures take authoritye of the church,<note place="margin">Frier So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</note> and that without the authority of the Church, the ſcriptures haue no authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>As though the Maieſty of Gods wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and his trueth conteined in the ſcriptures, depended vppon the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of man. For though the Church bee neuer ſo holie, yet it conſiſteth of men, which oftentimes haue and do erre, when

Indeed it is true, that as the Scriptures were written by the ſpirit of GOD:<note place="margin">2. Pet. 1.20</note> So muſt they be expounded by the ſame. For without that Spirit, we haue neither eyes to ſee, nor eares to heare.</p>
            <p>It is that ſpirit that openeth and no man ſhutteth: the ſame ſhutteth,<note place="margin">Ma. 11.15 Reu. 3 7</note> and no man openeth.</p>

Io. 2.22.</note> and that his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats and diſciples are the ſpirituall wolues of whom Chriſt in his goſpell geueth war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,<note place="margin">Mat. 7.15</note> though they couer themſelues neuer ſo cloſely vnder the clothing of Chriſtes true ſheepe.</p>
            <p>Chriſt was humble and lowly. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet in his owne perſon ſpeaketh of him: I am a worme and not a man: aſhame of men and the contempt of the people. And S. Paule ſaith he humbled himſelfe,<note place="margin">Pſ. 22.6 Phil. 2.8.</note> and became obedient vnto the death, euen the death of the croſſe.</p>
            <p>Behold his parents, his birth, his cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle: beholde his life, his diſciples, his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and his death: All were witneſſes to his humility. He ſaith of himſelf the ſon of man hath not whereon to reſt his head.
<pb facs="tcp:27222:6"/> And to his diſciples he ſaith,<note place="margin">Mat. 8.20.</note> The Kings of the Gentils raigne ouer them, &amp; they that beare rule ouer them are called gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Lordes: but you ſhall not be ſo.<note place="margin">Luk. 25.22 Ma. 11.29</note> And againe Learne of me that I am meek &amp; lowly in heart, and ye ſhall finde reſt vnto your ſoules. Now on the other ſide, if wee conſider the condition of Antichriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde his birth, his place, his chaire, his eſtate, his doctrine, his diſciples and al his life. there ſhal nothing be ſeene but pomp and vaine glory: he is proud in life,<note place="margin">The i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of Antichriſt</note> proud in doctrine, proud in word, and proude in deedes. He is like vnto Lucifer, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth himſelfe before his brethren, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer nations and kingdomes. He maketh kings and princes to kiſſe his feete, to cary his traine, to hold his ſtirrop. &amp;c. He clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth power ouer heauen and earth. Hee ſaith, he is Lord ouer all the worlde, the Lord of Lords, and King of Kings: that his authority reacheth vp into heauen &amp; down into hell: that whoſoeuer he bleſſeth, is bleſſed, and that it is curſed whatſoeuer he curſeth. He ſelleth merits, the forgiue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe of ſinnes, the ſacrifice for the quicke and the dead. He maketh marchandiſe of the ſoules of men, He remoueth Kings &amp; depoſeth the ſtats &amp; princes of the world.</p>
            <p>He taketh vpon him the authority and
<pb facs="tcp:27222:7"/> name of the liuing GOD which made he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auen and earth,<note place="margin">Extrauag Io. 22.</note> euen the name of GOD the Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. And in this pride hee exceedeth all others that haue bene wicked. But ſome will perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture reply, that the Pope at this daye is not called GOD, but that hee abaceth and writeth himſelfe by a title of humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and is called ſo the ſeruant of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts. Thus (indeede) he is written: but marke how much the matter is amended.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Extra. de Maior &amp; obedien.</note>This ſeruaunt ſaith, I doe make holy the vnholy. I do iuſtifie the wicked. I doe forgiue ſins. I open and no man ſhutteth.

            <p>Now the first Sheepes clothing (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall the falſe Prophetes and members of Antichristes ſchoole doe vſe to hide and couer their deueliſh hypocriſie) is faſting, prayer, almes deedes,<note place="margin">The firſt ſheeps clo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing wherwith the falſe Prophets doe hide the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues.</note> and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde holineſſe of life.

<pb facs="tcp:27222:8"/> by the ſentence and interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the holy counſelles, fathers &amp; do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors and yet (beeing rightly and truely examined) it is nothing ſo.</p>
            <p>They tell vs that they haue their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate Maſſe, their half co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion &amp; their trifling ceremonies fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Apostles. And all this (God knoweth) they proue by full ſimple coniectures, becauſe Christ ſaide to his Apoſtles:<note place="margin">Io. 16.12. 1. Co. 11.34.</note> I haue yet many things to ſay vnto you, but ye ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not beare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now. And becauſe S. Paul ſaid to the Corinth.

They haue made them neceſſary to ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: they haue bound the people no leſſe to them, then to the lawe of God: &amp; ſo haue they made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſnares for Chriſtian conſciences. And therefore if it were ſo that the thing it ſelf came fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the fathers, yet the abuſe thereof came from themſelues: and for the ſame they haue taught the people to breake Gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.<note place="margin">Eſay. 1.22.</note> Thus haue they mingled gods hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly

Therfore if ſo be the thing it ſelfe, they haue thus receaued (in reſpect of ſubſtance) be al one: yet being thus abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed (in reſpect of their ſuperſtitions and deformities) it is none one.</p>
            <p>Furthermore as a Lyon is diſcouered by his clawes (what garment ſo euer he haue vpon him) euen ſo theſe ſpirituall wolues (though they be couered with the clothing of Chriſtes true ſheepe:<note place="margin">The claws of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall wolues.</note> yet) if you looke vpon their clawes, you ſhall quickly eſpie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what they are.<note place="margin">The firſt</note> One of their clawes is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence in the holines of their life, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they do not only aduance themſelues as iust before God &amp; the worlde: but alſo contemne &amp; deſpiſe al other. Such a claw had the Phariſei that Chriſt ſpeaketh of, who in diſdaine of the poore ſinful (but yet repentant) Publican, maketh his vaunt in this manner:<note place="margin">Lu. 18.21.</note> I thanke shee (O Lorde) that I am not as other men are, extorcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, vniuſt, adulterers nor as this Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can &amp;c. Such are theſe religious men which in theſe dayes make their vaunts, that they are not only able ſo far to fulfill the law of God that they may be acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted righteous themſelues: but alſo that they
<pb facs="tcp:27222:9"/> haue their workes of ſupererogation and merites which may be ſolde and applyed to the benefite of other. This is knowen to be the common doctrine of the church of Rome at this day.<note place="margin">A ſecond clawe.</note> Another clawe of theſe countrfeited wolues is a certaine peculiar holineſſe, conſiſting in the obſeruation of mans traditions and deuiſes: of which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>The Phariſeis ſought to pleaſe men and to deceaue the people they taught them to walke in the wayes of their forefathers, to beleeue as they beleeued, to do as they had done. They flattered them and ſaide, you

The Scribes and the Phariſeis deuowred vppe widowes houſes vnder pretence of longe prayers: They gaue almes and made mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of their almes giuing: They fasted and made money of their fasting. This did the Scribes and Phariſeis, the which although are dead, yet their doinges con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſtill: their name is taken away, but their profeſsion abideth, As they made gaines of their prayers, of their almes and faſting; ſo doe the Papistes make great gaynes and waxe rich vnder pretence of holineſſe. They haue brought in a profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of wilful chaſtitie and forbidden ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in ſome whole eſtate of men. They haue forbidden to eate certaine meates vpon certaine dayes: whereas God hath left meates as free to the choyſe of man, as hee left his ſunne to ſhine freely to the vſe of all men, asnd they make free li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie for money to eate what euery man liketh. They make money of purgatorie, money of pardons, &amp; money of their maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. They make money of Peter, and of Paule: of the Apostles and Martirs &amp; of Christ himſelfe.

            <p>And now to returne to your worſhips. I moſt humbly beſeech you to accept this my poore labour, which I offer (vnder your names) to the whole church of God. The which as I know it commeth vnlooked for, not only in reſpect of your ſelues, but alſo of diuers other that knowe me (aſwel) in that countrey where I was born, as alſo in other places: ſo alſo it may ſeem very raſh
<pb facs="tcp:27222:10"/> and needles. For who am I, that I ſhould take vpon me to publiſh any thing? The vnworthieſt of many hundreds, &amp; the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableſt of many thouſands. And yet ſeeing many things more ſimple, leſſe needful &amp; profitable, are both permitted and ſuffred to come abrode: I am not altogether diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, neither hath any man iuſt cauſe to accuſe me in this my ſimple enterpriſe. I knowe theſe be the dayes of learning &amp; knowledge &amp; that there be great ſtore of learned deuines in our land (whom I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech the Lorde to bleſſe.<note place="margin">Mar. 12.42.43. Luk. 21.2.3.</note>) and yet the two mites of the poore widowe cast into the treaſurie (amonge the great giftes of the welthy) are not to be refuſed. The cauſes that moued me to dedicate this first fruit of my ſimple trauaile vnto your worſhips (aboue al other) are theſe. Firſt your great goodnes from time to time ſhewed towards me and my friendes: the which called vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mee contitually to ſhewe ſome token of thankefulneſſe for the ſame. For I must needes confeſſe that it hath vttered it ſelfe many and ſundry ways, and that not without a certaine friendly or rather fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly care of my well dooing. Secondlie, that it might be a meane, (through the aſsistaunce of Gods ſpirite) to kindle and inflame your heartes with an earnest
<pb facs="tcp:27222:11"/> zeale to the glorious goſpell of the ſonne of God, by dayly and continuall exerciſe and practiſe wherein you might be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently furniſhed with ſpirituall armur to endure conſtantly vnto the ende (as good ſouldiers of Ieſus Christ) against all the aſſaults of Sathan and his wicked inſtruments which (doe or may) come in ſheepes clothing to deceaue you and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray your ſoules from the way of ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For of this am I certaine, that there will not want falſe prophets entycing you from Christ, and that many ſtumbling blockes wilbe cast (namely and eſpecially in your way Master &amp; Miſtreſſe I efferis as once hertofore I preſumed to aduertiſe you priuately by letter) to the ende you might be diſcouraged from the way of the Lorde. But beware (I beſeech you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine) of their Angelicall or Seraphicall ſhewe of heauenly life. Haue not by and by their doctrine in admiration but care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully looke vnto the clawes of theſe ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall wolues and indifferently (without affection) examine the grounde of their profeſsion, by the rule and touchstone of the worde of God: and you ſhall prooue that they deale deceitefully &amp; with guile: that they be falſe Apoſtles and deceitefull workers: that they goe about to beguile
<pb facs="tcp:27222:11"/> your ſenſes and to blinde your eyes: that they call you to worſhip an Idoll in ſteed of the true and liuing God: and that they would lead you out of light into darkneſſe: from truth into error: from knowledge vnto ignorance.</p>
            <p>If you ſhall vouchſafe to reade this little booke, and to examine it throughly &amp; indifferently by the word of God: and then (it beeing effectually confirmed by the ſame) to make your profit according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and (as it is committed to your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection: ſo) to maintaine and defende it: I ſhall not onely be ſatisfied and thinke my payes ſufficiently recompenced: but alſo be greatly encouraged hartily to pray vnto the Lorde to encreaſe the giftes of his holy ſpirite in you, that you may goe forwarde more and more to performe that dutie in obedience which he requireth at your handes: that you may ouerleape all the lets that Sathan can cast in your way &amp; continue in the certainty of true faith: and that you may be fully ſetled vppon the death and paſsion of our Lorde Ieſus Christ being aſſured that the ſame onelie is of ſufficient abilitie to drawe you out of the dungeon of death.</p>
            <p>And I beſeech your worſhippes, that as God in aboundant meaſure, hath mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully
<pb facs="tcp:27222:12"/> endued you with all thinges neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie for this life: (whereof many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandes feele the want) ſo without ceaſing you would prayſe and magnifie him for the ſame. And as you are ſo nearely ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together, not onely by reaſon of your poſſeſsions, but eſpecially by the bonde of mariage that you are brethren &amp; ſisters: that ſo you would ioyne togeather in the ſincere profeſsion of the glorious goſpel of the ſonne of God, and ſo goe forward more and more in practiſe therof: that the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel (being rooted in your heartes) it may bring foorth ſanctification, the true ſeale of your adoption, that you may feele his goodneſſe in the aſſurance of that euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting and heauenly truth. Beware of theſe two cankers I beſeech you, that corrupt the whole world, I meane, pride and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſneſſe: Let them not once be named among you as becommeth ſainctes.<note place="margin">Eph. 5.3. Col. 3.5.</note> A day will come, when the Lorde will fill your hope with better things then al this world can giue you. Stande fast in his trueth in theſe ſlippery dayes, and aboue all, let his glorye, and the aduancement of his worde, be deare and precious vnto you. In Gods matters, let his will bee the rule thereof, and not your owne wiſedome and affections, Examine your ſelues often by
<pb facs="tcp:27222:12"/> it, and neglect not the pure preaching of the ſame. Delight in the lawe of the Lord and be good examples to others. Care not for the contempt of the worlde, but holde fast a good conſcience, that you may be approued of God. And our Lorde Ieſus Christ giue you the forgiueneſſe of all your ſinnes, and the peace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of your conſcience. The Lorde let all his bleſsinges fall vppon you, that you may ſee the riches and treaſures of his mercie: that you may be filled with all ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with the ſpirit: that you may behold the glory of the kingdome of god, &amp; thoſe thinges be reuealed vnto you by his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, which hee hath prepared for them that loue him.

The ſtory of Chriſt is briefly comprehended vnder his paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and reſurrection, the vſe and ende wherof is that we ſhould haue repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and remiſſion of ſinnes in his name.</p>

               <p>And this doth Chriſt himſelfe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes when as he ſaid to his Apoſtles after his reſurrection:<note place="margin">Luk. 24.46.</note> thus it is wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and thus it behoued Chriſt to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffer, and to riſe againe the third day, and that repentaunce and remiſſion of ſinnes ſhoulde bee preached in his name, among all nations. To this agreeth the Apoſtle Peter when as he ſaith, with other the Apoſtles, to the Counſell and chiefe Prieſtes. The God of our Fathers hath rayſed vp Ieſus whom ye ſlue, and hanged on a tree:<note place="margin">Act. 5.30.31.</note> him hath GOD lifte vp with his right hande to bee a Prince and a Sauiour to giue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentaunce vnto Iſraell and remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinnes. By this we may ſee how the Goſpel muſt be preached, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple muſt be taught what Chriſt hath done for them. The whole ſtorye of his Incarnation, conception, birth, ſufferinges, reſurrection and aſcention, muſt be oftentimes and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually preached vnto them, as they are ſet downe by the Euangeliſtes and Apoſtles: but yet this is not inough to ſhewe what Chriſte hath done, and to rehearſe the ſtorie of his incarnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miniſter muſt be

               <p>REpentance is a true turning vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, a chaunging of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and inwarde man, a dying to ſinne, a liuing to righteouſneſſe, and amendment of the whole life. Hee which is returned vnto God, ought firſt neceſſarily to know and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, how he fell from him, and to know what God is, how we fall from him, and how we ought to turne to him againe.<note place="margin">Mat 9.12.</note> So that he which muſt repent, ought to know his own nough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, and wickednes, and alſo by what meanes the ſame may be amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded which is broken and ſpoyled: but theſe thinges can in no wiſe be done of any wretched ſinner, vnleſſe they be drawne hereunto, and therein inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the ſpyrit and word of God,<note place="margin">Mar. 1.15.</note>

Example hereof maye bee taken of Iudas, who repenting for his ſinnes, confeſſed the ſame to the Prieſtes in the temple ſaying: I haue ſinned in betraying the innocent bloud:<note place="margin">Mat. 27.3.5.</note> yea and he in this prate made ſatiſfaction in that he threw the vnrighteous price of bloud into the temple. But this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance did nothing at all profite him (although he had in it contriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, confeſſion, and ſatiſfaction) and becauſe he lacked true faith, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payred and hanged himſelfe. On the other ſide,<note place="margin">Luk. 22.61.62.</note> the Lord looking backe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Peter (and the Cocke crowing) he remembred his wordes, and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them, departed from the wicked companie, wept for his ſinnes and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended his faultes: and this his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentaunce
